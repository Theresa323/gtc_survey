    <p>This study consists of 1) general questions, 2) an online game and 3) a final survey. It will take  altogether around 10 minutes and help us to further explore the research field of Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Thank you for your participation.</p>
        
    <p>Your task is to match ten pictures from Google Streetview to their four originating cities. All pictures originate from Berlin and Hamburg in Germany and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in Israel. At the same time, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) completes the same task and shares its suggested matches with you as feedback, so that you can learn from the AI’s suggestions</p>
    <p> Each round you are asked to match a picture to one of these four cities. Afterwards, the AI performs the same tasks and shares its guess with you. Hence, you can study the AI’s suggestion and consider implications for your next task, another Google Streetview picture to be matched to its originating city. Please always keep in mind that the AI is good but not perfect. At the end of the study you will receive your final score as well as the AI's performance score.</p>
        
    <p>Please be diligent when answering the questions and completing your task of matching Google Streetview pictures. There are attention checks, which have to be passed to receive financial compensation. The amount of your financial compensation increases based on your performance to up to X.XXEUR. </p>
