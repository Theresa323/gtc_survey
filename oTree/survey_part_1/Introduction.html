    <p>This study consists of 1) general questions, 2) an online game and 3) final survey. It will take  altogether around 15 minutes and help us to further explore the research field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Thank you for your participation.</p>
        
    <p>You will play a game against an Artificial Intelligence (AI). The aim is to correctly match pictures from Google Streetview to their originating cities. All pictures originate from Berlin and Hamburg in Germany and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in Israel. </p>
    <p> Each round you are asked to match a picture to one of these four cities. Afterwards, the AI  performs the same tasks. The AI is good but not perfect. At the end of the study you will receive your final score compared to the AI's performance. </p>
        
    <p>Please be diligent when answering the questions and playing the online game. There are attention checks, which have to be passed. </p>
