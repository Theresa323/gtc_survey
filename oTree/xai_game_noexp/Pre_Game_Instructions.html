    <p>Well done - you now get to play the game "Guess the City".</p>
    <p>The following section explains how the game works. Please read the instructions carefully, as your financial compensation will depend upon your performance.</p>
    <p>You will be shown different pictures from Google Streetview that you need to classify according to their city of origin:
        <ul>
            <li>Berlin (Germany)</li>
            <li>Hamburg (Germany)</li>
            <li>Tel Aviv (Israel)</li>
            <li>Jerusalem (Israel)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Doing this, you play against an Artificial Intelligence (AI) which performs the same tasks. After having made your choice for each picture you will see how the AI has decided.</p>
    <p>You will play 10 rounds against the AI. Good luck!</p>
