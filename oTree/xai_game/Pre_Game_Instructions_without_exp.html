    <p>Many thanks - you now get to play the game "Guess the City".</p>
    <p>The following section explains how the game works. Please read the instructions carefully as your financial compensation will depend upon your performance. All attention checks need to be passed to receive financial compensation and the amount of your financial compensation increases based on your performance – the top 50% of participants earn 1.00 EUR on top of the base compensation.</p>
    <p>Your task is to match different pictures from Google Streetview to their city of origin:
        <ul>
            <li>Berlin (Germany)</li>
            <li>Hamburg (Germany)</li>
            <li>Tel Aviv (Israel)</li>
            <li>Jerusalem (Israel)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) completes the same task and shares its suggested matches with you as feedback, so that you can learn from the AI’s suggestions. After having made your choice for each picture, you will see the AI's guess. Hence, you can study the AI’s suggestion and consider implications for your next task, another Google Streetview picture to be matched to its originating city.</p>
    <p>You will be asked to match 10 pictures in total. Good luck!</p>
