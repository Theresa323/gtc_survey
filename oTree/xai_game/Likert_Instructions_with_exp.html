    <p>Thank you for playing our game! We hope you had fun interacting with the AI (Artificial Intelligence)!</p>
    <p>Remember, your task was to match Google Streetview pictures to their four originating cities. For each match made by you, you were afterwards provided with feedback and got to see the match suggested by the AI. Further, you were provided with an explanation, on which pixels have helped the AI in making its choice. Hence, you had the opportunity to consider this information for your upcoming tasks.</p>
        
    <p>Subsequently you will be asked some final questions to evaluate your experience  in interacting with the AI. Please be diligent, when answering this survey. Please remember, there are attention checks, which have to be passed to receive financial compensation.</p>
    <p>Having completed this final stage, we will re-direct you to your compensation.</p>
