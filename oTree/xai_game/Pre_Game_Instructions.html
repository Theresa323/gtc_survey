    <p>Next, you will play the game "Guess the City".</p>
    <p>The following section explains how the game works. Please read the instructions carefully.</p>
    <p>Your task is to classify pictures from Google Streetview, that were taken in one of these four cities: 
        <ul>
            <li>Berlin (Germany)</li>
            <li>Hamburg (Germany)</li>
            <li>Tel Aviv (Israel)</li>
            <li>Jerusalem (Israel)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>There is no time limit for entering your choice but the time will be tracked. You also need to be prepared to justify you choice afterwards.</p>
    <p>After you log in your guess, you will see what the AI answers. </p>
    <p>---to add: framing the AI vs. the User; explaining what the marked segments in the explanation mean---</p>
    <p>(The AI will then provide an explanation for its choice by showing you how it classified the picture.)</p>
    <p>You will play 15(?) rounds.</p>
    <p>Have fun!</p>
