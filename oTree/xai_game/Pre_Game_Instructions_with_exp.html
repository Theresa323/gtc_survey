    <p>Many thanks - you now get to play the game "Guess the City".</p>
    <p>The following section explains how the game works. Please read the instructions carefully as your financial compensation will depend upon your performance. All attention checks need to be passed to receive financial compensation and the amount of your financial compensation increases based on your performance – 50% of all participants earn 1.00EUR on top of the base compensation.</p>
    <p>Your task is to match different pictures from Google Streetview to their city of origin:
        <ul>
            <li>Berlin (Germany)</li>
            <li>Hamburg (Germany)</li>
            <li>Tel Aviv (Israel)</li>
            <li>Jerusalem (Israel)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>At the same time, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) completes the same task and shares its suggested matches with you as feedback, so that you can learn from the AI’s suggestions. After having made your choice for each picture, you will see the AI's guess and an explanation, on how the AI formed its suggestion:</p>
    

    <img src="{{ static 'gtc_survey/xai_game/image001.png' }}" width="300" heigth="300"/>



    <p>In this example, you can see which pixels were highly relevant to the AI in forming its decision. Those pixels could be interpreted as followed: The AI identified the almost cloudless sky, the sea and the beach to be an indication for its originating city, namely Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>By reviewing the AI’s suggested match and its provided explanation, you can study the AI’s suggestion and consider implications for your next task, another Google Streetview picture to be matched to its originating city.</p>
   
    <p>You and the AI will play 10 rounds. Good luck!</p>
