    <p>You now get to play the game "Guess the City", where your task is to match pictures from Google Streetview to their city of origin. 
        You increase your financial compensation (+1.00 EUR) if you are among the top 50% of participants. 
        All participants match 10 pictures.</p>
    <p>An Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to give you the chance to become better in your task: 
        The AI completes the same task and shares its suggested match as feedback. 
        Note that the AI’s suggestion is correct with a chance of 85%. 
        Furthermore, the AI uncovers picture areas that were relevant for its suggestion. 
        In the following exemplary picture, the colored areas were highly relevant for the AI’ suggestion “Tel Aviv”.</p>

    <p>The colored areas could be interpreted as follows: The AI identified the sand colored and square building, sidewalk, and street markings to be an indication for the picture originating from Tel Aviv.</p>
    <p>You can study the AI’s feedback and consider implications for the next pictures. </p>
   
    <p>Good luck!</p>
